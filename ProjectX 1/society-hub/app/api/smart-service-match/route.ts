A resident submitted this query: "${query}"

STEP 1 — Detect intent. Classify the query as exactly ONE of:
- "purchase": user wants to buy a product (e.g. cat litter, groceries, furniture)
- "repair": user reports something broken or not working (e.g. AC not cooling, tap leaking)
- "service": user needs a service performed (e.g. cleaning, installation, grooming, tutoring)
- "inquiry": user is asking a general question or is unclear

STEP 2 — Write a short, natural description of the request in one sentence.
Rules:
- Write it like a clean service request, not a template
- DO NOT use phrases like "User needs assistance with", "User is requesting", "User requires"
- DO NOT add generic filler like "professional assessment needed" or "skilled labour required"
- DO NOT assume repair unless the user explicitly says something is broken or not working
- Use natural, direct language — as if a human wrote the request clearly
- Examples:
  - "I want cat litter" → "Wants to purchase cat litter for home use."
  - "AC not cooling" → "AC is not cooling and needs a repair visit."
  - "Need house cleaning" → "Looking for a home deep-cleaning service."
  - "I wanna renovate my 2 bhk with false ceiling" → "Wants to renovate a 2 BHK home with false ceiling work."
  - "laptop not working" → "Laptop has stopped working and needs repair."
  - "need yoga classes" → "Looking for home yoga sessions."

STEP 3 — Match to 3–5 relevant categories from this list ONLY: ${categoryList}
Rules:
- DO NOT mismatch intent to category (e.g. pet purchase → do NOT suggest repair categories)
- Use exact category IDs from the list
- Order by relevance, most relevant first
- If intent is "purchase", prefer categories like courier, food, pet, etc.
- If intent is "repair", prefer categories like plumbing, electrical, appliance, ac, vehicle, etc.
- If intent is "service", prefer categories like cleaning, gardening, beauty, fitness, laundry, etc.

STEP 4 — Estimate cost based on intent and category (Indian market, INR):
- purchase: Rs. 100 – Rs. 2,000 (unless high-value item)
- repair: Rs. 300 – Rs. 5,000 (depends on complexity)
- service: Rs. 200 – Rs. 3,000 (depends on scope)
- If unclear: use category default range

Respond ONLY with valid JSON, no markdown, no extra text:
{
  "intent": "purchase|repair|service|inquiry",
  "description": "One clear sentence matching the intent",
  "estimatedCost": "Rs. X – Rs. Y",
  "matches": [
    {"categoryId": "exact_id", "reason": "one short sentence why this matches", "confidence": "high|medium"}
  ],
  "summary": "one sentence describing what the user needs"
}

CRITICAL: Return 3–5 matches. Use exact category IDs. Do not hallucinate categories not in the list. Do not assume intent not stated.`;
